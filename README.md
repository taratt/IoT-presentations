## A Survey on NB-IoT
The file survey_NBIoT.pdf is my presentation file for a presentation based on my study on NarrowBand Internet of Things, which I described a history, features of each release of NB-IoT, and features and procedures of each layer (focused on physical and mac layer) in detail.

## Quality of Service “Smart queue” and traffic prioritization for NB-IoT

The file Quality_of_service_Smart_queue_and_traffic_prioritization_for_NB-IoT.pdf is my presentation slides based on the paper with the same title. In this presentation, I describe general and detailed points and aspects of the paper and share my personal insights and observations on it.
